# Day 1
## Initialized and completed Back-end set up for application

We initialized the back-end of our project using Express.js framework. This framework provides a variety of features for web and mobile applications.
Express also allows for easily creating an API.

## Set Up Continued
We then utilized Postman to test our back-end to ensure it was working correctly. 

Finally we then set up our database using PostgreSQL and partnered that with PgAdmin 4 as the GUI Tool.
